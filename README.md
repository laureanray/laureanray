# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laurean Ray. I am a graduating computer engineering student. Currently working @ Eclaro as a Junior Java Developer. 
I like building things during my free time. My interests can vary a lot in a very short timespan (that's why I have so many unfinished side projects) I like low level stuffs to machine learning and computer vision algorithms and anything in between.
