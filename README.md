  I like building things during my free time.  
  My interests can vary a lot in a very short timespan. (that's why I have so many unfinished side projects lol) :sweat_smile:  
  I like open source software, linux, new technologies, web, android, and desktop development, also interested in computer vision and machine learning stuffs.  
  I consider myself a **generalist**, which can be my best or worst attribute depending on how you look at it. :wink:
