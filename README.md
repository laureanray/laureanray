# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laurean Ray. I am a Computer Engineering graduate. Currently working @ Eclaro as a Junior Java Developer. 
I like building things during my free time. My interests can vary a lot in a very short timespan (that's why I have so many unfinished side projects) I like open source software, linux, new technologies, web, android, and desktop development, also interested in computer vision and machine learning stuffs.
